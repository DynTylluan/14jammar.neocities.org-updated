# Dumb of owlman.neocities.org/14jammar (Updated version)

All the way back in 2015, I was still in my teenage years (indeed the worst years for anyone) and I wanted to put myself out there on the Web for all to see, I had made a few websites before, but they were all drag and drop ones that are okay, but I never felt like they were a good way to express yourself all that well, that's when I found out about [Neocities](https://neocities.org), the free web host that I would join and upload my site too.

I was very new to HTML, and it shows, but everyone has to start somewhere and this was where I would begin my website journey at.

This mirror of the code is almost a one-to-one of what would have been seen - the only real thing changed here is only visible in the code; I have only changed links to things like images from being broken, but this is such a small change that you would not notice it.

This is one of three gits relating to my first hand-written website:

* [14jammar.neocities.org-old](https://github.com/DynTylluan/14jammar.neocities.org-old): A mirror of [owlman.neocities.org/14jammar](https://owlman.neocities.org/14jammar)
* 14jammar.neocities.org-updated: This git that is a version of the site that no longer has my deadname on.
* [14jammar.neocities.org](https://github.com/DynTylluan/14jammar.neocities.org): The current version of the website that redirects to owlman.neocities.org
